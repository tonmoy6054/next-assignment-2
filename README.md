To run a Node.js Express application with TypeScript and integrate MongoDB using Mongoose, i follow these steps:

#Initializing a new Node.js project:
mkdir my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm init -y

#Installing required dependencies.
npm install express mongoose typescript @types/node @types/express @types/mongoose ts-node

#Creating a tsconfig.json file.

#Modifying the tsconfig.json file to include the following:
"outDir": "./dist",
"rootDir": "./src",

# Setting up my project structure(model)

    #Creating an app.ts & server.ts file in the src directory
    #then rearrangeing my project (model type) where i use interface,model,controllers, service, routes typescript file.


    #run project locally:
        "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",
        i use this command
        my git repo link: https://github.com/tonmoy6054/next-assignment-2

# How others use it:

    When collaborating on a TypeScript Express application with MongoDB and Mongoose, you might use version control (like Git) and a platform like GitHub to share code with others. Collaborators can clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and run the application using npm start. It's common to set up a README file with instructions on how to run the project, any environment variables needed, and information about the MongoDB setup
